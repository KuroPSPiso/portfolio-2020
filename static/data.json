Within a weeks time we had to learn and create a Unreal Engine 4 Game that would work with the Oculus DK2. In our game you do not need any controllers other than to own a Head-mounted Display. Our mechanic for executing movement is teleportation once you look down and basic body positioning with the tracking capabilities of the Oculus DK2s Infrared Camera.</p>",
